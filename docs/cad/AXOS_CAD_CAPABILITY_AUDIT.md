# AXOS CAD Capability Audit

Last updated: 2026-06-29

This audit tracks the non-redundancy check for the CAD tree sprint. It is scoped to the current mainline CAD implementation and open PR risk observed during this run.

| Capability | Exists? | Files | Maturity | Gap | Next non-redundant PR | Owner files | Collision risk with open PRs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unified CAD workbench | Yes | `apps/web/src/components/line-engineering/Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `docs/cad-industrial-workbench.md` | strong | Still a large single file; fullscreen shell extraction remains pending. | Extract workbench chrome only after PR 746 lands. | `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, future `cad-workbench/*` | High: PR 746 edits `Layout3DEditor.tsx`. |
| Command dock and registry | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/commands/*`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `docs/cad-copilot-command-contract.md` | usable | Commands mostly mutate existing objects; few compound industrial workflows. | Add compound commands that reuse `move`/`connect`/`report` operations. | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/commands/*` | Low: no open CAD command PR found. |
| Flow health | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/flow-optimization.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Flow suggestions are not yet one-click compound workflows. | Preview-first flow-line command and later richer flow panel actions. | `flow-optimization.ts`, `commands/registry.ts` | Low unless touching viewport UI. |
| Layers and locks | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/layers.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Local only until backend persistence contract is wired. | Persist layer assignments after contract review. | `layers.ts`, layout API types | Medium: avoid if another layer PR opens. |
| Industrial symbols | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/symbols.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Inserted symbols are mapped to current asset archetypes, not native block instances. | Add native block-instance model after symbol persistence decision. | `symbols.ts`, future block helpers | Medium if touching symbol palette UI. |
| DXF import/export | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/dxf-import.ts`, `dxf-export.ts`, `layout-export-adapter.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Editable import is still limited to supported primitives and conversion caps. | Layer-selective DXF import review. | `dxf-*`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | Medium: avoid if DXF PR appears. |
| Validation center | Partial | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/validation-report.ts`, `collisions.ts`, `safety-zones.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Needs richer issue actions and ignored/local issue state. | Build validation side panel after viewport PRs settle. | `validation-report.ts`, editor UI | Medium due Layout editor churn. |
| Measurements and annotations | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/measurements.ts`, `annotations.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Dimension styles and release rules are basic. | Add dimension style helper and UI controls. | `measurements.ts`, `annotations.ts` | Low for helper-only; medium for UI. |
| CAD layout templates | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/templates.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Templates are local editable starters; no backend template library yet. | Add parametric rack/line generators after current template UX settles. | `templates.ts`, editor equipment rail | Medium: small editor insertion, avoid broader shell edits. |
| Command palette and shortcuts | Yes | `command-palette.ts`, `keyboard-shortcuts.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | More command examples and compound workflows needed. | Add workflow commands before new UI. | `commands/*`, `command-palette.ts` | Low. |
| Local snapshots | Yes | `snapshots.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Session-local; backend version workflow separate. | Snapshot before more high-risk conversions. | `snapshots.ts`, editor versions modal | Medium if touching versions UI. |

## Current run decision

Open CAD PRs touched validation, layers, shortcuts, and command-registry workflows, so this run avoided those primary areas. The selected improvement adds pure CAD layout templates in `apps/web/src/lib/cad/templates.ts` and wires them into the existing equipment rail in `Layout3DEditor.tsx`. The templates instantiate current editable assets, connectors, annotations, layer assignments, tags, local snapshots, and Flow Health state instead of introducing a parallel editor or persistence model.
