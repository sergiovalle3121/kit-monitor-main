# AXOS CAD Capability Audit

Last updated: 2026-06-29

## 2026-06-29 - Safety path zone update

Open CAD PRs inspected before this run included #869 (symbols), #864 (DXF preflight), #861 (validation quick fixes), #858 (dimensions), #853 (templates), #850 (flow), #847 (plot metadata), #844 (warehouse generator), and #838 (line-balance command). This run avoided those primary ownership areas and extended the existing Safety zone path instead of creating another validation center, symbol system, or editor.

| Capability | Exists? | Files | Maturity | Gap | Next non-redundant PR | Owner files | Collision risk with open PRs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Safety zones / aisle validation | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/safety-zones.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/cad/collisions.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/cad/object-properties.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/line-engineering/Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | No-go/restricted zones existed, but ESD zones and safety paths were not first-class validation inputs. | Add editable clearance-rule controls per safety zone after active validation/editor PRs settle. | `safety-zones.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` Safety rail | Medium: `Layout3DEditor.tsx` is active in other CAD PRs, so this run kept edits Safety-panel scoped. |

Existing capability found: the CAD workbench already had a Safety rail, zone assets, object tags, layer assignments, validation highlights, `evaluateSafetyZones`, and the shared `buildCadValidationReport` modal.

What this run reused: editable `zone` and `agvpath` assets, Safety/Aisles layers, object tags, validation highlights, the existing design-check modal, and the object properties safety classification helper.

What this run extended: `CadSafetyZoneKind` now covers ESD zones, forklift paths, and emergency exits. Aisles and paths now report blocker-style obstructions through the existing safety issue list, while ESD zones warn when overlapping objects lack ESD classification.

What this run wired into `Layout3DEditor`: the existing Safety rail now creates ESD zones, forklift safety paths, and emergency exit paths. Current assets tagged as aisles, no-go, restricted, ESD, forklift, or emergency paths are converted into safety zones for the shared validation report.

What this run intentionally did not duplicate: no new editor, no new validation modal, no new path renderer, no new symbol library, no new layer model, and no new persistence path.

Why this is non-redundant: it turns the existing Safety layer from generic no-go rectangles into a more industrial validation workflow for plant layouts, using the workbench objects users can already edit and export.

This audit tracks the non-redundancy check for the CAD tree sprint. It is scoped to the current mainline CAD implementation and open PR risk observed during this run.

| Capability | Exists? | Files | Maturity | Gap | Next non-redundant PR | Owner files | Collision risk with open PRs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unified CAD workbench | Yes | `apps/web/src/components/line-engineering/Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `docs/cad-industrial-workbench.md` | strong | Still a large single file; fullscreen shell extraction remains pending. | Extract workbench chrome only after PR 746 lands. | `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, future `cad-workbench/*` | High: PR 746 edits `Layout3DEditor.tsx`. |
| Command dock and registry | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/commands/*`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `docs/cad-copilot-command-contract.md` | usable | Commands mostly mutate existing objects; few compound industrial workflows. | Add compound commands that reuse `move`/`connect`/`report` operations. | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/commands/*` | Low: no open CAD command PR found. |
| Flow health | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/flow-optimization.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Flow suggestions are not yet one-click compound workflows. | Preview-first flow-line command and later richer flow panel actions. | `flow-optimization.ts`, `commands/registry.ts` | Low unless touching viewport UI. |
| Layers and locks | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/layers.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Local only until backend persistence contract is wired. | Persist layer assignments after contract review. | `layers.ts`, layout API types | Medium: avoid if another layer PR opens. |
| Object properties inspector | Yes | `apps/web/src/components/line-engineering/Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `apps/web/src/lib/cad/object-properties.ts` | usable | Rich metadata is local-only until object metadata persistence is approved. | Persist notes/tags/source metadata through the layout API contract. | `object-properties.ts`, editor properties panel | Medium: open CAD PRs also touch `Layout3DEditor.tsx`; keep changes panel-scoped. |
| Industrial symbols | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/symbols.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Inserted symbols are mapped to current asset archetypes, not native block instances. | Add native block-instance model after symbol persistence decision. | `symbols.ts`, future block helpers | Medium if touching symbol palette UI. |
| Shared industrial asset catalog | Yes | `apps/web/src/components/line-engineering/asset-catalog.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Catalog now covers core equipment, logistics, Safety/EHS, and utilities, but inserted items still rely on active layer assignment rather than per-asset default layers. | Add native block-instance metadata/default layer hints after active symbol/template PRs land. | `asset-catalog.ts`, editor equipment rail | Low: this run avoids active `symbols.ts`, `templates.ts`, DXF, layers, commands, validation, flow, measurements, and editor edits. |
| DXF import/export | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/dxf-import.ts`, `dxf-export.ts`, `layout-export-adapter.ts`, `dxf-export-readiness.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | strong | Export now has preflight/layer package readiness; editable import still needs layer-selective review. | Layer-selective DXF import review. | `dxf-*`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | Medium: this PR owns DXF export readiness only. |
| DXF import/export | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/dxf-import.ts`, `dxf-export.ts`, `layout-export-adapter.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | strong | Editable import is still limited to supported primitives and conversion caps; export labels now travel with footprint geometry. | Layer-selective DXF import review and export preflight warnings. | `dxf-*`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | Low this run: no open DXF PR found. |
| Validation center | Partial | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/validation-report.ts`, `collisions.ts`, `safety-zones.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Needs richer issue actions and ignored/local issue state. | Build validation side panel after viewport PRs settle. | `validation-report.ts`, editor UI | Medium due Layout editor churn. |
| Measurements and annotations | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/measurements.ts`, `annotations.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Dimension styles and release rules are basic. | Add dimension style helper and UI controls. | `measurements.ts`, `annotations.ts` | Low for helper-only; medium for UI. |
| Command palette and shortcuts | Yes | `command-palette.ts`, `keyboard-shortcuts.ts`, `toolbar.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | strong | Enter/confirm history reconciliation and clipboard paste remain pending. | Add Enter confirmation and clipboard workflows after editor conflicts settle. | `keyboard-shortcuts.ts`, `toolbar.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | Medium: touches editor keyboard handler, but avoids viewport/minimap code. |
| CAD layout templates | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/templates.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Templates are local editable starters; no backend template library yet. | Add parametric rack/line generators after current template UX settles. | `templates.ts`, editor equipment rail | Medium: small editor insertion, avoid broader shell edits. |
| Command palette and shortcuts | Yes | `command-palette.ts`, `keyboard-shortcuts.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | More command examples and compound workflows needed. | Add workflow commands before new UI. | `commands/*`, `command-palette.ts` | Low. |
| Local snapshots | Yes | `snapshots.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Session-local; backend version workflow separate. | Snapshot before more high-risk conversions. | `snapshots.ts`, editor versions modal | Medium if touching versions UI. |

## Current run decision

Open CAD PRs include #799 (`codex/night-cad-rack-row-command`) and #796 (`codex/night-cad-validation-center`), plus draft #746 with viewport/minimap/editor-shell work. This run avoided command-registry expansion, DXF conversion, layers, validation-center internals, viewport/minimap helpers, and shell extraction. The selected improvement extends the existing shortcut and toolbar path: `Layout3DEditor.tsx` already imports `matchCadShortcut`, renders toolbar actions, and routes palette tool entries through `runToolbarAction`, so this PR makes those existing actions keyboard-usable instead of adding another editor or action dispatcher.
Open CAD PRs currently touch shortcuts, layers, validation clearances, and rack-row commands. This run avoided those primary concerns and reused the existing `exportCadLayoutDxf` adapter plus the existing DXF export modal. The selected improvement adds a DXF export readiness helper and wires it into `Layout3DEditor.tsx` so users see entity counts, included layers, hidden-layer exclusions, validation/DXF warnings, and true blockers before downloading.
Open CAD PRs #805, #804, #801, and #796 all edit `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, so this run avoided viewport, shortcut, layer-manager, and validation-center surfaces. The selected improvement extends the existing right properties panel with a pure object-properties helper, local notes, object source/safety metadata, and multi-selection summaries. It reuses existing selection snapshots, CAD layers, tags, DXF import tags, and lock state instead of creating a parallel inspector or object model.
Open CAD PRs touch `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, command registry, layers, shortcuts, toolbar, templates, object properties, and validation report. This run avoided those files and selected DXF export hardening because the existing `Layout3DEditor.tsx` export modal already calls `exportCadLayoutDxf`. The adapter now reuses the existing primitive `text` field so exported station/equipment/safety footprints carry readable DXF labels, and it passes deterministic layer color definitions to the existing exporter.
PR 746 edits `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `PlantMinimap.tsx`, `ScaleBar.tsx`, and new CAD scale/minimap helpers. This run avoided viewport and editor shell work. The selected improvement extends the existing command registry with a compound flow-line command that is already reachable through the CAD command dock and palette because `Layout3DEditor.tsx` consumes registry commands through `parseCadCommand`, `previewCadCommand`, and `executeCadCommand`.

## Validation center update

The next non-redundant CAD gap selected for PR #796 is visible clearance validation. The clearance helper already existed in `apps/web/src/lib/cad/collisions.ts` and was aggregated by `apps/web/src/lib/cad/validation-report.ts`, but the design-check modal only surfaced collisions and safety-zone issues. The PR wires that existing report into `Layout3DEditor.tsx` so release readiness, highlights, and modal rows share one validation source.
Open CAD PRs touched validation, layers, shortcuts, and command-registry workflows, so this run avoided those primary areas. The selected improvement adds pure CAD layout templates in `apps/web/src/lib/cad/templates.ts` and wires them into the existing equipment rail in `Layout3DEditor.tsx`. The templates instantiate current editable assets, connectors, annotations, layer assignments, tags, local snapshots, and Flow Health state instead of introducing a parallel editor or persistence model.

## 2026-06-29 - EHS and utilities asset catalog update

Open CAD PRs at run start included #870 (layer visibility), #869 (manufacturing symbols), #864 (DXF critical label preflight), #861 (validation quick fixes), #858 (edge clearance dimensions), #853 (supermarket kitting template), #850 (flow health reorder preview), #847 (plot package metadata), #844 (warehouse generator), #838 (line-balance command), and draft #746 (viewport/minimap/editor shell). This run avoided `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `apps/web/src/lib/cad/symbols.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/cad/templates.ts`, DXF helpers, layers, commands, validation, flow, and measurements.

The selected non-redundant improvement extends the existing shared `asset-catalog.ts` used by `Layout3DEditor.tsx` and the 2D layout editor. New Safety/EHS and Utilities groups add editable fire extinguisher, eyewash, emergency exit path, first-aid, spill kit, PPE station, power panel, compressed-air drop, network drop, maintenance area, tool crib, and calibration station blocks. These reuse the existing mesh archetypes (`cabinet`, `path`, `bin`, `column`, `zone`, `shelf`, `desk`) and are visible through the current Equipment rail because it already renders `ASSET_CATEGORIES`.
