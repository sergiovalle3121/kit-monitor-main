# AXOS CAD Capability Audit

Last updated: 2026-06-29

This audit tracks the non-redundancy check for the CAD tree sprint. It is scoped to the current mainline CAD implementation and open PR risk observed during this run.

| Capability | Exists? | Files | Maturity | Gap | Next non-redundant PR | Owner files | Collision risk with open PRs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unified CAD workbench | Yes | `apps/web/src/components/line-engineering/Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `docs/cad-industrial-workbench.md` | strong | Still a large single file; fullscreen shell extraction remains pending. | Extract workbench chrome only after PR 746 lands. | `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, future `cad-workbench/*` | High: PR 746 edits `Layout3DEditor.tsx`. |
| Command dock and registry | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/commands/*`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `docs/cad-copilot-command-contract.md` | usable | Commands mostly mutate existing objects; few compound industrial workflows. | Add compound commands that reuse `move`/`connect`/`report` operations. | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/commands/*` | Low: no open CAD command PR found. |
| Flow health | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/flow-optimization.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Flow suggestions are not yet one-click compound workflows. | Preview-first flow-line command and later richer flow panel actions. | `flow-optimization.ts`, `commands/registry.ts` | Low unless touching viewport UI. |
| Layers and locks | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/layers.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | strong | Local only until backend persistence contract is wired; visible/hidden layer behavior is now enforced in viewport selection and DXF export. | Persist layer assignments after contract review. | `layers.ts`, layout API types | Medium: avoid if another layer PR opens. |
| Industrial symbols | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/symbols.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Inserted symbols are mapped to current asset archetypes, not native block instances. | Add native block-instance model after symbol persistence decision. | `symbols.ts`, future block helpers | Medium if touching symbol palette UI. |
| DXF import/export | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/dxf-import.ts`, `dxf-export.ts`, `layout-export-adapter.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Editable import is still limited to supported primitives and conversion caps. | Layer-selective DXF import review. | `dxf-*`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | Medium: avoid if DXF PR appears. |
| Validation center | Partial | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/validation-report.ts`, `collisions.ts`, `safety-zones.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Needs richer issue actions and ignored/local issue state. | Build validation side panel after viewport PRs settle. | `validation-report.ts`, editor UI | Medium due Layout editor churn. |
| Measurements and annotations | Yes | `apps/web/src/lib/cad/measurements.ts`, `annotations.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Dimension styles and release rules are basic. | Add dimension style helper and UI controls. | `measurements.ts`, `annotations.ts` | Low for helper-only; medium for UI. |
| Command palette and shortcuts | Yes | `command-palette.ts`, `keyboard-shortcuts.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | More command examples and compound workflows needed. | Add workflow commands before new UI. | `commands/*`, `command-palette.ts` | Low. |
| Local snapshots | Yes | `snapshots.ts`, `Layout3DEditor.tsx` | usable | Session-local; backend version workflow separate. | Snapshot before more high-risk conversions. | `snapshots.ts`, editor versions modal | Medium if touching versions UI. |

## Current run decision

PR 746 edits `Layout3DEditor.tsx`, `PlantMinimap.tsx`, `ScaleBar.tsx`, and new CAD scale/minimap helpers. This run avoided viewport and editor shell work. The selected improvement extends the existing command registry with a compound flow-line command that is already reachable through the CAD command dock and palette because `Layout3DEditor.tsx` consumes registry commands through `parseCadCommand`, `previewCadCommand`, and `executeCadCommand`.

## 2026-06-29 follow-up run decision

This run inspected open CAD risk and reused the existing CAD layer helper/editor integration instead of adding a parallel layer manager. The selected improvement makes CAD layer visibility real inside `Layout3DEditor.tsx`: hidden layers now hide station labels, equipment, flow connectors, and measurements; selection, command context, and DXF export respect hidden layers; and hidden/locked target layers block creation/assignment actions with explicit toast feedback.
