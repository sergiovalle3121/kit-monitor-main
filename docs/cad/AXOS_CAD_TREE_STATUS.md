# AXOS CAD Tree Status

Last updated: 2026-06-29

## Current tree state

AXOS CAD is beyond seed state. The active workbench already includes a unified 2D/3D editor, local command dock, command palette, layers, lock enforcement, measurements, symbols, DXF import/export, validation, safety checks, flow scoring, local snapshots, CAD templates, and a release-readiness surface.

## This run

This run expands the existing CAD symbol library into a stronger manufacturing block set:

- `symbols.ts` now includes solder paste printer, SPI, pick-and-place, reflow oven, X-ray inspection, ICT, functional test, conformal coating, depaneling, manual assembly, quality gate, label print, and calibration station symbols.
- Each new symbol carries default footprint dimensions, Equipment-layer assignment, manufacturing/search tags, and normalized flow/exception ports.
- The existing `Layout3DEditor.tsx` symbol rail and Cmd-K palette pick these up automatically from `CAD_SYMBOL_LIBRARY`; inserted blocks become editable assets with labels, layer assignment, selection, undo, validation, and DXF export through the current paths.
- No parallel block editor, command registry, DXF exporter, template system, or generator was created.

This run hardens the existing CAD keyboard shortcut path:

- `keyboard-shortcuts.ts` now includes draw/insert/productivity actions for aisle, connector, zone, equipment, text, fit view, grid, object snap, validation, and DXF export.
- `Layout3DEditor.tsx` routes those shortcuts through the existing toolbar, validation, export, grid, and object-snap actions instead of creating a parallel action system.
- The in-editor help overlay lists the newly usable keys so the workflow is discoverable from inside CAD.
- `toolbar.ts` now exposes matching shortcut hints for the command palette/tool index.

The workflow is visible in the CAD workbench immediately: users can press `A`, `L`, `Z`, `I`, `T`, `F`, `G`, `O`, `Shift+V`, and `E` to run existing CAD actions. It does not introduce a parallel editor, duplicate toolbar actions, duplicate validation, or duplicate DXF export logic.
This run hardens the existing DXF export workflow:

- `dxf-export-readiness.ts` evaluates the export package before download.
- The existing DXF export modal now shows a ready/blocked state, entity counts, included layers, hidden-layer exclusions, validation warnings, and active DXF import warnings.
- Selection exports now block only when nothing is selected or no entities match the options.
- Hidden Flow/Measurements/Text visibility is reflected in the modal and in the actual downloaded DXF.

The workflow is visible through the existing `Layout3DEditor.tsx` DXF export action. It does not introduce a second exporter, a parallel editor, or a new DXF model; it reuses `exportCadLayoutDxf` and the current modal.
This run upgrades the existing object properties inspector:

- A pure `object-properties` helper derives object bounds, area, center, source metadata, safety classification, warnings, and multi-selection summaries.
- The right inspector now shows local object notes, DXF/source metadata, safety classification, object center, and lock/visibility warnings.
- Multi-selection now shows group bounds, area, station/equipment split, layer spread, and locked/hidden object counts.
- The helper is covered by a pure smoke spec.

The workflow is visible through the existing `Layout3DEditor` properties panel. It does not introduce a parallel inspector, object model, layer model, or DXF metadata path.
This run hardens the professional DXF export path:

- Layout footprint boxes now export their `text` labels as centered DXF `TEXT` entities.
- The existing `Layout3DEditor.tsx` export modal benefits without a new UI path because it already calls `exportCadLayoutDxf`.
- Exported layer tables now receive deterministic AutoCAD color codes for Layout, Equipment, Flow, Aisles, Measurements, Safety, and Text.
- Entity counts include generated footprint labels, so the existing export toast remains honest.

The workflow does not introduce a parallel exporter, a second export modal, or a new geometry model. It reuses `CadDxfPrimitive.text`, `cadLayoutToDxfExportModel`, and `exportCadDxf`.
This run adds an editable CAD template workflow:

- `templates.ts` defines industrial starter layouts for EMS mini factory, SMT line, warehouse racks, and packing/shipping cell.
- Templates instantiate existing asset kinds, connectors, annotations, CAD layer assignments, and tags.
- The equipment rail now exposes a compact "Plantillas CAD" launcher.
- Applying a template creates a local snapshot before mutation, selects the generated editable objects, and primes Flow Health from generated connectors.
- Oversized templates scale to the current footprint and report a warning instead of overflowing silently.

The workflow is visible in `Layout3DEditor` and reuses the current editable layout model. It does not introduce a parallel editor, duplicate symbol systems, duplicate flow scoring, or a new persistence path.

## 2026-06-29 - Supermarket and kitting template

This run extends the existing editable template workflow without touching the editor shell:

- `templates.ts` now includes a "Supermarket + kitting" starter layout with receiving drop, incoming QC, material supermarket, kanban lanes, kitting carts, FIFO WIP, line-side delivery, replenishment rack, visual kanban board, forklift/pedestrian aisles, ESD boundary, quarantine, and operator position.
- The existing `Layout3DEditor` template rail picks it up automatically because it already maps `CAD_LAYOUT_TEMPLATES`.
- Applying it creates editable assets, annotations, layer assignments, object tags, connectors, local snapshot coverage, selection, flow-health priming, and DXF-exportable geometry through the current template path.
- `templates.spec.ts` now covers the new template's kanban/kitting tags, safety/aisle layers, and material/flow connectors.

This does not create a second warehouse generator, block system, editor, layer model, flow model, or DXF path. It keeps the current generator PRs independent while giving users another plant-layout starter they can apply immediately.

## Next CAD PR

Recommended next phase: add validation issue quick actions or editable connector grips after PR 746 lands, so `Layout3DEditor.tsx` conflicts can be resolved against the latest viewport/minimap changes.
Recommended next phase: add a layer-selective DXF import review or a validation-report attachment option for DXF packages, depending on which open CAD PRs land first.

## Next CAD PR

Recommended next phase: persist object notes/tags/source metadata through the layout API after the object metadata contract is reviewed, or move to editable connector actions if `Layout3DEditor.tsx` churn remains high.
Recommended next phase: add DXF export preflight warnings for empty selection, hidden layers, missing footprint labels, and unsupported converted DXF entities once the active editor PRs settle.
Recommended next phase: add an editable connector workflow or validation issue actions after PR 746 lands, so `Layout3DEditor.tsx` conflicts can be resolved against the latest viewport/minimap changes.

## Validation center update

PR #796 advances the existing validation center by making the design-check modal use the shared CAD validation report for collisions, clearances, safety, and flow. User-visible additions are clearance warning rows, selection/highlight on clearance issues, CAD validation severity in the status bar, and release-readiness counts that distinguish blockers from warnings. It does not add a parallel validation engine, collision helper, CAD shell, or flow model.
Recommended next phase: add a parametric rack row or SMT line generator with user inputs, building on `templates.ts` and the existing editable asset/connector model.

## Warehouse generator update

This run adds the first parametric warehouse generator:

- `warehouse-generators.ts` creates editable rack bays, forklift aisle assets, and text labels from rows, bays per row, bay width, rack depth, aisle width, orientation, and prefix.
- `Layout3DEditor.tsx` exposes the generator in the existing equipment rail, creates a local snapshot before mutation, assigns CAD layers/tags, selects generated objects, and refreshes the current 3D/2D viewport.
- Oversized rack layouts are capped/scaled with warnings instead of overflowing silently.

The workflow is visible in CAD and reuses the current editable layout model. It does not duplicate the existing `arrange_rack_rows` command, because that command arranges selected racks while this generator creates new rack rows.

Recommended next phase: add a supermarket lane generator or receiving/shipping dock generator using the same generator output contract.
## 2026-06-29 - EHS and utilities asset blocks

This run extends the existing shared asset catalog instead of creating a third symbol/block system:

- `asset-catalog.ts` now includes Safety/EHS blocks for fire extinguishers, eyewash, emergency exits, first aid, spill kits, and PPE stations.
- `asset-catalog.ts` now includes Utilities blocks for power panels, compressed air, network drops, maintenance areas, tool cribs, and calibration stations.
- `Layout3DEditor.tsx` already renders `ASSET_CATEGORIES` in the Equipment rail, so these blocks are immediately insertable, editable, selectable, duplicateable, measurable, and included in the existing DXF export adapter.
- The blocks reuse existing asset archetypes instead of adding new Three.js rendering paths.
- `asset-catalog.spec.ts` covers uniqueness, grouping, footprints, and archetype reuse.

Phase evidence: Phase 11 (Blocks / industrial symbols) advances from generic core equipment toward a fuller plant-layout library. Next non-redundant step is native block-instance metadata/default layer hints after active `symbols.ts` and template PRs settle.
